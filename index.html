                I was born on the 25th of August 1993 to Christopher and Sharon Governali. 
                I have two siblings: my older sister Victoria, and my younger brother Raphael. 
                For the first ten years of my life we lived in Queens, NY. 
                My mother worked as a High School English teacher and my father freelanced in security system installations.
                Like many kids at the time I got into video games. Pokemon was my introduction to video games and it quickly expanded from there.
                My introduction to music came when I entered 3rd grade. 
                I chose to learn clarinet. Ididn't know much about music at the time and squidward played clarinet so I figured why not.
                Just before turning ten, my family moved to Somers NY, a small town in northern Westchester. 
                <br><br>
                When we moved to Somers I quickly made new friends. We moved in the beginning of summer so we had time to become familiar with the town before heading back to school.
                Over the years I would take on new instruments and hobbies. I went paintballing with a few friends of mine and fell in love immediately.
                I also got into airsoft for a little while. I eventually replaced clarinet with saxophone, then attempted trumpet, but none of these stuck for long.
                At some point I discovered my dad's copy of "How the West Was Won" - a live album by Led Zeppelin. This was my first introduction to music and what eventually moved me to take up guitar.
                I formed a band in high school, and while we were by no means good, it was a fun way to hang out and eat disgusting amounts of pizza.
                I also joined the boy scouts part way into high school. Most of my friends were already in one of the local troops. This was my introduction to outing activites.
                Camping quickly became one of my favorite activites and it is something I still enjoy to this day.
                <br><br>
                After high school I studied Mechanical Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. 
                It was there that I became exposed to programming and begun to take an interest in it. 
                Upon graduating I began my career in the Aerospace Industry working an Assembly/Test Engineer for a commercial jet engine manufacturer.
                After a few years of this I began to feel that this wasn't the career path I wanted to follow.
                I began teaching myself some front end development in my spare time and decided to apply for a bootcamp.
                I'm excited to see where it will take me.
                <br><br>
                These days I like to spend my free time noodling on the guitar, playing video games, going for some light hikes, and going to as many concerts as I can.
